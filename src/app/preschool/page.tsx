            <h3>Our Curriculum: A Bespoke Triad of Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              At the heart of our academic success is a meticulously crafted
              blended curriculum designed for the modern, global child. We do
              not believe in a “one size fits all” approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Montessori principles are deeply integrated to foster
              independence, self-discipline and hands-on discovery. Our
              environments are curated to ensure foundations built in preschool
              are truly exceptional.
            </p>
            <p>
              Literacy excellence is driven through the world-renowned{" "}
              <strong>Jolly Phonics</strong> system, empowering pupils with
              confident reading, language mastery and a lifelong love for
              literature.
            </p>
            <p>
              These pillars are strengthened by a traditional academic framework
              that prepares our scholars for smooth transition into elite
              primary schools, consistently exceeding international benchmarks.

            <h3>Homework Policy</h3>
            <p>
              We believe in <strong>Purposeful Extension</strong> rather than
              repetition. Home-based tasks are meaningful and designed to engage
              families without disrupting the essential balance of rest, play
              and relaxation.
