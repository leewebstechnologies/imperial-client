          <h2 className="sectionTitle">Why Choose Imperial Legacy School</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing the right school marks a significant new beginning in the
            life of a child. It is a decision that shapes not only academic
            outcomes but character, confidence, and lifelong values. At Imperial
            Legacy School, we partner intentionally with families to give every
            child a strong, balanced foundation for life.
          </p>

          <p>
            With over 10 years of educational excellence, Imperial Legacy School
            is proudly secular, guided by the belief that education should unite
            rather than divide. Our pupils develop empathy, cooperation,
            critical thinking, and respect for diversity in a nurturing
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            We focus on equipping pupils with discipline, leadership skills, and
            global competence—qualities they will draw upon throughout their
            lives.
