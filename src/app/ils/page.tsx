                <h2>Welcome to Imperial Legacy School</h2>
              </div>
              <div className="about-cont">
                <p>
                  Imperial Legacy School, formerly known as Imperial Kiddies,
                  was established in 2016 in Magboro, Ogun State, Nigeria. It
                  began as a crèche service with a deeply rooted mission: to
                  support working parents by providing a safe, nurturing, and
                  stimulating environment for their children during their most
                  formative years. Our vision was to redefine early childhood
                  care in Magboro and its environs, creating a model that
                  harmonised love, structure, and purpose. Our humble beginnings
                  were shaped by resilience, vision, and passion. Starting as a
                  one-woman initiative led by the founder, Olabisi Adisa, the
                  school has grown from a crèche of four children to a thriving
                  educational institution. From serving as the caregiver,
                  cleaner, marketer, and administrator, Olabisi laid a strong
                  foundation of service and purpose. By 2019, we had
                  successfully fulfilled our initial mission in early childhood
                  education and transitioned into a full-fledged primary school.
                  The rebranding to Imperial Legacy School symbolised our new
                  identity one driven by the desire to build enduring legacies
                  through education. Despite the personal tragedy of losing her
                  husband in 2020, the director&apos;s commitment to the vision
                  only strengthened, forging ahead to uphold and expand the
                  dream they once shared. Today, in 2025, Imperial Legacy stands
                  as a beacon of holistic learning, home to over 50 staff and
                  hundreds of pupils. We grow purposefully, one class at a time,
                  and proudly celebrate our first Grade 5 cohort this year.

                  <h4>Why a Secular School?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Imperial Legacy School is proudly secular because we believe
                    that education must unite, not divide. In today’s
                    interconnected world, the most critical skills children must
                    learn are empathy, cooperation, and respect for diversity. A
                    secular school provides the most fertile ground for this to
                    happen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here, children learn side-by-side from different
                    backgrounds, growing into compassionate citizens who
                    understand the world beyond dogma. Religion is best nurtured
                    from home school is where we teach critical thinking,
                    character, discipline, and social responsibility. Our
                    inclusive environment fosters real-world readiness,
                    emotional balance, and global competence.
